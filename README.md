# Making Product Knowledge Graphs from Customer Reviews

User Reviews on various e-commerce websites have a lot of product comparison based valuable information. I aim to extract that information out and represent it in a meaningful form, as a graph. This system will then expose a query interface where you can give the following types of queries and get the inferences drawn from reviews written by users worldwide:

1. Type in the Product Names and the Product Feature to compare
2. Type in the Feature you are for and get the best products
3. Type in a Product Name and get to know user opinions about its various features

This is my Bachelor Degree Project and is currently under development.
