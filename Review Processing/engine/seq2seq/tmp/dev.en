I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries.
Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
I did a full charge of these batteries and they ran as long if not a bit longer than the Energizer batteries.
So once you calculate that these can be charged 800 times, they are a MUCH better deal than buying normal batteries all the time.
I also bought a 4 pack of the 1850mAh batteries because all the reviews said the charger came with 1700's and the 1850's were that much better.
A friend of mine bought a relatively expensive DVD player and it didn't have some of the features this unit has (albeit its a bit smaller).
I bought this player when it first came out; VHS/DVD combo players were brand new and seemed much more sensible than separate players.
The bottom line on this unit is that the DVD side looked very good and the VCR performed just about the same as my stand-alone units which I own.
The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it.
Yet.Enter the TRV-108, a nifty little video camera that uses the HiBand 8mm format, superior to 8mm, but certainly not in the ballpark of Digital8 or DV.
The camera is equipped with a nightshot mode that actually does work, amplifying light in dark areas, making the image more visible, if green.
Hi8 is fast fading into oblivion as MiniDV takes over the world and gets cheaper.
My old hi 8 went caput after 10 years use that was very trouble free.The new one has way more features that the 100 and costs much less.
This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony.
The image is so much better than my phone new camcorder.
We dont intend to use it on the computer so the analog camera is a better deal for us than digital.
You can also choose the battery with the higher life time.4.
The majority of analog camcoders do not offer all the features as this, along with the quality and usability, the 608 is your best bargain.It is smaller than the average and yet has the larger screen (3 inch).
Dazzle USB brings in my movies faster with no post processing time, it also produces a MPEG-1 movie.
yes the picture qulaity is a little lower then the DV's but i dont know about you but i dont want to spend 1300 (I dont know about you brother but im not made of money) on a camra im not tha picky.
They sounded better than I had expected, though seemed to struggle a bit on bass side.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy again, though would consider upgrading to one of their higher-end models if fidelity was higher on the cost/fidelity preference scale.
Image quality is excellent, but we did notice that it performs better after it has 'warmed up'.
Fade in/out options are excellent and with the 'cinema' setting gives your production that 'ER' feel.I suspect that upgrading to a higher capacity battery may be a next step, but it lasted through the kid's party with ease.
I find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital.
I needed a third camcorder with NightShot for my paranormal investigations and since I have two Mini DV's, wanted a Hi8 because they record for so much longer (tape length).
One note, the built in NightShot on this camera is at least twice as bright as the NightShot on my two newer Mini DV models.
One of them was a near-perfect match for my Palm i705 stylus, and in fact fit even better than the factory stylus in that it isn't as tight a fit.
It's working fine so far & is waaaaay cheaper that ordering a replacement from Apple.
The only downside is that it's a bit less sleek and ergonomic than the Apple.
This product is much better than the Apple OEM charger in terms of durability.
At least it works which is better that Apple's cool looking charger that doesn't work long.BEWARE OF OTHER IMITATIONS!!!!
The only problem is that it is slightly more bulky than the apple one.
Much cheaper than a new apple adapter and works just as nicely.
It is also sturdier than the apple adaptor and does not have the annoying light.
Apple's version of the same product is substantially more expensive.
I really disappointed....the charger looks different than my first ones, but it looks sturdier and better.
This one works fine, though it might charge the battery more slowly than the Apple brand charger did, or I could be imagining it.
But overall it does what it's supposed to do and it's a lot cheaper than the Apple cord.
Believe me, it's not worth the lower cost for this - just get a more expensive one that actually works.
Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better.
This charger is a replacement for the one i lost but it works great because my G4 Battery actually last longer and this is an aftermarket charger it also maintains steady temp.
I think it's more flimsy than the Apple AC Adapter and so I question its ability to hold up to typical use in the long term.
It is not as pretty as the Apple adapter, but it's way cheaper and it does the job.
It also feels more durable than the Apple adapter, but that wasn't hard to do as the Apple one is extremely flaky.
Works just as good as the Apple chord for a lot less!
I've just had bad luck with Mac adapters.. this one is wonderfully long cord, much longer than apples' adapter..
The Macally Powerbook iBook AC adapter was much cheaper and works great.
It is is built sturdier than the Apple power cord, and best of all, it was less than half the price (Apple power cords cost you a hefty $80).
Who needs Mac accessories when you can have an equally good (or better) product like Macally powerbook Ibook ac adapter?
We turned to Amazon to order the Macally AC adapter with some trepidation because the price was lower than the Mac-made product.
A lot cheaper than the apple version but does the exact same thing.
It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer.
it came, it works and it is a lot cheaper than apple's outrageous replacement price
The laptop connecter is sturdier and other components appear to be adequate.
I'm very pleased with this product which costs less than half the price of Apple's sexy but hopelessly flawed accessory.
At first it appeared more durable and I only missed the lighted rim of the original a little bit.
My macally adapter is much more durable.
I read that its power output was slightly lower; frankly, I can't tell the difference.
Its power ratings are not exactly the same as the original 45W Apple adapter.
It actually charges my 12" Pbook slightly faster.
It costs less than half the original.The white brick is very light and there is a locking mechanism on the cable from the brick to the laptop.
After the cord frayed on the original, the thought of spending lots of money just to use an out of date laptop, was a bit much.This adapter gave us a less expensive alternative.
That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable.
It is more durable than the Apple adaptor, and it seems to expand longer too.
I actually like it better than the original one from Mac, smaller and somewhat handier.
I have ordered this for my laptop and find it is cheaper than buying one from the Apple store and works just as good.
It works fine and is a much better buy.
I take back my previous comments as now this adapter is dead, and MUCH faster than my original one.
Considerably less feeble or dangerous than the Mac adapter.
